            <p class="description">The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised
                John
                Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band
                of
                all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as
                an
                art form. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised
                many
                aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural
                movements.</p>
